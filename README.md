# Walmart Advanced Software Engineering Job Simulation - Forage
This repo contains the starter code for task #4, which involved three CSV files of different formats. 

I was tasked with obtaining relevant information and munging the data to be inserted into 'product' and 'shipment' tables of a SQLite database. I used Python (Jupyter Notebook).
The finished Python script can be seen in task4.ipynb. Creation of connection to database, steps taken (with comment explanations) to correctly extract data and insert.
